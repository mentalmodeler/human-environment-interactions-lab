								<p>Welcome to the Human-Environment Interactions Lab at Michigan State University!<p/><p>Our group is interested in understanding how human behavior relates to the sustainability of socio-ecological systems. Understanding the complexity of human-environment interactions requires significant collaboration between both scientists from other environmental fields (economists, mathematicians, sociologists, ecologists, agronomists, marine scientists) and the humans that are interacting with the environment (fishers, farmers, land-owners and the general public).</p><p><img class="feature width50" src="img/img_1.jpg" alt="human-environment interaction scenario 1" ><img class="feature width50" src="img/img_4.jpg" alt="human-environment interaction scenario 4" ></p><p>We think that it is this collaboration that makes environmental research interesting and will ultimately help us better understand the nature of current environmental problems and help us create more sustainable solutions for the future.</p>

								<p>Our research concentrates on understanding how individuals and groups make decisions about complex social-ecological systems with a focus on how values, attitudes, beliefs or local conditions influence human behavior. It is always our goal to link these data to other datasets (although not always possible!) so that we can explain environmental or social change.</p><p><img class="feature width50" src="img/img_3.jpg" alt="human-environment interaction scenario 2"><img class="feature width50" src="img/img_2.jpg" alt="human-environment interaction scenario 3"></p>

								 <p>To understand the various ways in which humans' interact with their environment, we use several social science (e.g. interviews, surveys, focus groups), participatory modeling (e.g. fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping, agent-based models) and natural science (e.g. watershed modeling, agricultural measurements) methods. In addition, we are currently developing new frameworks and software tools to make this type of interdisciplinary research more commonplace in the future.</p><p>This work draws from a range of disciplines (e.g., cognitive psychology, systems sciences, planning, ecology, and computer science) and has been supported by NSF, NOAA, USEPA, BLM, USDA, the Leibniz Institute (Germany) and the Australian Academy of Sciences.</p>

								I enjoy teaching and student mentorship because it offers me an opportunity to refine my own knowledge while introducing students to new concepts, ways of reasoning, and methods to measure and understand the complexity of our external world. Additionally, I find it very rewarding when students are able to communicate this reasoning and understanding to others, both personally and through academic presentations and writing. This enjoyment might be best exemplified by the diversity of my teaching and mentorship experiences with students. In terms of mentorship, I have worked with undergraduate students from a variety of fields including environmental policy and planning, biology, education, mathematics, and natural resource management. I developed and taught courses in environmental and natural resource policy, environmental politics, social-ecological research methods, modeling, statistics and applied calculus, conflict resolution, and a series of research methods and quantitative analysis courses. Examples of these courses can be found below:

							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<p>Participatory modeling has grown in popularity in recent years with the acknowledgement that stakeholder knowledge is an essential component in effective environmental decision-making. Including stakeholders in model building and model analysis allows decision-makers to understand important conceptual components in the system under management, build trust and common understanding between often diverse and competing groups, and reduce uncertainty by mining information that might not be a part of scientific assessment performed by experts alone. Although the benefits of participatory modeling are somewhat clear, scientific modeling software used routinely by experts is often too complicated for many novice users.</p><p>For the last four years, I have been developing open-source participatory-modeling software called Mental Modeler (<a href="http://www.mentalmodeler.org" target="_blank">www.mentalmodeler.org</a>) that utilizes a fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping (FCM) approach and allows environmental stakeholders opportunities to develop semi-quantitative models of social-ecological systems. This software is designed with two goals in mind. The first is to afford stakeholders and other decision-makers an opportunity to understand the perceived structure of a managed system as well as how the system may react under a range of social and environmental scenarios. This appropriation uses the software as a collaborative learning tool which standardizes knowledge across types (local ecological, traditional ecological, scientific, etc.), allows real-time understanding of potential outcomes of future scenarios, and can create meta-models of stakeholder knowledge.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<p><img src="img/mm_Scenario_1.jpg"/></p><p>The second goal of the software is to popularize and facilitate "mental modeling" as a social-science method by collecting and quantitatively comparing the beliefs of individual stakeholders and to characterizing community-level knowledge about environmental or social issues. This appropriation allows the knowledge of different stakeholders to be quantitatively compared using network measures and can be used to understand conditions under which the predicted outcomes associated with different environmental policy or change scenarios are shared or divergent across stakeholder groups. The following examples illustrate how this approach has been used in a range of studies</p>
